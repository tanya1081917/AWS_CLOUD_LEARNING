Success! Created zeal-app at D:\ZL_Work\NEW_REACT_28_09\REACT_ZEAL2022\zeal-app
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can’t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd zeal-app
  npm start

√ Help improve Amplify CLI by sharing non sensitive configurations on failures (y/N) · no
Deployment bucket fetched.
√ Initialized provider successfully.
✅ Initialized your environment successfully.

Your project has been successfully initialized and connected to the cloud!

Some next steps:
"amplify status" will show you what you've added already and if it's locally configured or deployed
"amplify add <category>" will allow you to add features like user login or a backend API
"amplify push" will build all your local backend resources and provision it in the cloud
"amplify console" to open the Amplify Console and view your project status
"amplify publish" will build all your local backend and frontend resources (if you have hosting category added) and provision it in the cloud

Pro tip:
Try "amplify add api" to create a backend API and then "amplify push" to deploy everything


D:\ZL_Work\NEW_REACT_28_09\REACT_ZEAL2022\zeal-app>amplify add api
? Select from one of the below mentioned services: REST
√ Provide a friendly name for your resource to be used as a label for this category in the project: · Registration
√ Provide a path (e.g., /book/{isbn}): · /registration/{registerUserName}
Only one option for [Choose a Lambda source]. Selecting [Create a new Lambda function].
? Provide an AWS Lambda function name: regitrationProcess
? Choose the runtime that you want to use: NodeJS
? Choose the function template that you want to use: CRUD function for DynamoDB (Integration with API Gateway)
? Choose a DynamoDB data source option Create a new DynamoDB table

Welcome to the NoSQL DynamoDB database wizard
This wizard asks you a series of questions to help determine how to set up your NoSQL database table.

√ Provide a friendly name · userdetail
√ Provide table name · userdetail

You can now add columns to the table.

√ What would you like to name this column · Y
√ Choose the data type · string
√ Would you like to add another column? (Y/n) · no

Before you create the database, you must specify how items in your table are uniquely organized. You do this by specifying a primary key. The primary key uniquely identifies each item in the table so that no two items can have the same key. This can be an individual column, or a combination that includes a primary key and a sort key.

To learn more about primary keys, see:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.CoreComponents.html#HowItWorks.CoreComponents.PrimaryKey

Only one option for [Choose partition key for the table]. Selecting [Y].
√ Do you want to add a sort key to your table? (Y/n) · yes
🛑 You must add additional keys in order to select a sort key.

You can optionally add global secondary indexes for this table. These are useful when you run queries defined in a different column than the primary key.
To learn more about indexes, see:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.CoreComponents.html#HowItWorks.CoreComponents.SecondaryIndexes

√ Do you want to add global secondary indexes to your table? (Y/n) · no
√ Do you want to add a Lambda Trigger for your Table? (y/N) · yes
√ Select from the following options · Choose an existing function from the project
🛑 No functions were found in the project. Use 'amplify add function' to add a new function.
Successfully added DynamoDb table locally

Available advanced settings:
- Resource access permissions
- Scheduled recurring invocation
- Lambda layers configuration
- Environment variables configuration
- Secret values configuration

? Do you want to configure advanced settings? No
? Do you want to edit the local lambda function now? No

Next steps:
Check out sample function code generated in <project-dir>/amplify/backend/function/regitrationProcess/src
"amplify function build" builds all of your functions currently in the project
"amplify mock function <functionName>" runs your function locally
To access AWS resources outside of this Amplify app, edit the D:\ZL_Work\NEW_REACT_28_09\REACT_ZEAL2022\zeal-app\amplify\backend\function\regitrationProcess\custom-policies.json
"amplify push" builds all of your local backend resources and provisions them in the cloud
"amplify publish" builds all of your local backend and front-end resources (if you added hosting category) and provisions them in the cloud
✅ Succesfully added the Lambda function locally
√ Restrict API access? (Y/n) · no
√ Do you want to add another path? (y/N) · no
✅ Successfully added resource Registration locally

✅ Some next steps:
"amplify push" will build all your local backend resources and provision it in the cloud
"amplify publish" will build all your local backend and frontend resources (if you have hosting category added) and provision it in the cloud
