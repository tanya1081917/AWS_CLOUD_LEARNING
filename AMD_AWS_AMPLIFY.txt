Deployment bucket fetched.
âˆš Initialized provider successfully.
âœ… Initialized your environment successfully.

Your project has been successfully initialized and connected to the cloud!

Some next steps:
"amplify status" will show you what you've added already and if it's locally configured or deployed
"amplify add <category>" will allow you to add features like user login or a backend API
"amplify push" will build all your local backend resources and provision it in the cloud
"amplify console" to open the Amplify Console and view your project status
"amplify publish" will build all your local backend and frontend resources (if you have hosting category added) and provision it in the cloud

Pro tip:
Try "amplify add api" to create a backend API and then "amplify push" to deploy everything


D:\ZL_Work\NEW_REACT_28_09\REACT_ZEAL2022\zeal-app>amplify add api
? Select from one of the below mentioned services: REST
âˆš Provide a friendly name for your resource to be used as a label for this category in the project: Â· Registration
âˆš Provide a path (e.g., /book/{isbn}): Â· /registration/{registerUserName}
Only one option for [Choose a Lambda source]. Selecting [Create a new Lambda function].
? Provide an AWS Lambda function name: regitrationProcess
? Choose the runtime that you want to use: NodeJS
? Choose the function template that you want to use: CRUD function for DynamoDB (Integration with API Gateway)
? Choose a DynamoDB data source option Create a new DynamoDB table

Welcome to the NoSQL DynamoDB database wizard
This wizard asks you a series of questions to help determine how to set up your NoSQL database table.

âˆš Provide a friendly name Â· userdetail
âˆš Provide table name Â· userdetail

You can now add columns to the table.

âˆš What would you like to name this column Â· Y
âˆš Choose the data type Â· string
âˆš Would you like to add another column? (Y/n) Â· no

Before you create the database, you must specify how items in your table are uniquely organized. You do this by specifying a primary key. The primary key uniquely identifies each item in the table so that no two items can have the same key. This can be an individual column, or a combination that includes a primary key and a sort key.

To learn more about primary keys, see:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.CoreComponents.html#HowItWorks.CoreComponents.PrimaryKey

Only one option for [Choose partition key for the table]. Selecting [Y].
âˆš Do you want to add a sort key to your table? (Y/n) Â· yes
ðŸ›‘ You must add additional keys in order to select a sort key.

You can optionally add global secondary indexes for this table. These are useful when you run queries defined in a different column than the primary key.
To learn more about indexes, see:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.CoreComponents.html#HowItWorks.CoreComponents.SecondaryIndexes

âˆš Do you want to add global secondary indexes to your table? (Y/n) Â· no
âˆš Do you want to add a Lambda Trigger for your Table? (y/N) Â· yes
âˆš Select from the following options Â· Choose an existing function from the project
ðŸ›‘ No functions were found in the project. Use 'amplify add function' to add a new function.
